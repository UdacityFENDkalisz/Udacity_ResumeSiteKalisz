        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>When beginning my professional career, my highest priorities were finding a job that was fast-paced and intellectually demanding with high job security and moral fulfillment. Uncovering these values led me to pursue a career in physical therapy, earning a Bachelor’s of Science and a Doctorate of Physical Therapy. This was before I had held a full-time job and realized how highly I value other priorities, such as flexibility and opportunity for advancement. With each clinical role, I have re-assessed my values, and have come to realize that it is time for a career change to a role that will be a better fit. Software engineering requires a lifelong learner who is skilled in persistent observation, astute problem solving, open communication,  and professional teamwork – all skills that I have honed in on during my career as a physical therapist and can translate to software engineering.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by! At first glance, web development and physical therapy may seem like an
          incongruent combination, but both require a passion for lifelong learning, systematic thinking, clear
          communication, and designing detailed plans. I am a compassionate problem solver and driven professional. When
          I am not working on developing my software engineering skills, you will likely find me hunting for sea glass
          on one of the beaches of New Hampshire’s seacoast, relaxing with friends and a flight at a local brewery, or
          challenging myself in the White Mountains on a hike. Find out more about my journey below!</p>

          <div class="about__me__text">
            <p>I grew up in a suburb of Chicago, IL with three siblings who have inspired and challenged me, nurturing a
              highly motivated and self-driven individual. Discipline and teamwork were instilled in me at a young age
              by both playing and watching sports – go Cubbies, Packers and Blackhawks! My respect for the arts and keen
              interest in an ongoing pursuit of knowledge was solidified by trips to word class museums and attending
              performances. The shores of Lake Michigan sparked my love for the beach, while my desire to travel was
              cultivated by trying foods from around the world (plus lots of deep-dish pizza!).</p>

            <p>I completed my undergraduate degree earning a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology from the University of
              Wisconsin at Madison in May of 2015. Club and activity involvement included being elected as Vice
              President of the School of Education’s Kinesiology Club, participating in club ice hockey, and
              volunteering with Badger Volunteers. I held two jobs throughout my college career as a research assistant
              with a pediatric cardiopulmonary lab as a Campus Visit Specialist with Campus and Visitor Relations, which
              involved managing multiple accounts and collaborating with Campus Partners to plan specialty visits and
              tours for approximately 30,000 guests per year. Throughout my undergraduate career I stayed busy while
              keeping up with my studies, demonstrating excellent time management, communication and prioritization of
              tasks.</p>

              President for the Student Physical Therapy Association, and volunteering for student-run Student Health
              Action Coalition. I held a job as an office coordinator while juggling coursework and clinical rotations.
              Once again, time management and communication were integral to my success, and my critical thinking and
              problem-solving skills were put to the test. After graduation, I moved to New Hampshire to begin my career
